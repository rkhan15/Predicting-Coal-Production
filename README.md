# Predicting-Coal-Production
I used several time series forecasting models to predict monthly bituminous coal production in the U.S.A. with under 7% error on average.

# Files in Repository
`monthly-bituminous-coal-producti.csv` contains monthly data on bituminous coal production from 1952-1959, obtained from 		https://datamarket.com/data/set/22or/monthly-bituminous-coal-production-in-usa-1952-1959#!ds=22or&display=line.

`coal.R` contains the data cleaning and predictive modeling I conducted on the above data set.
